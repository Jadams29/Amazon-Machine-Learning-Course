# Amazon-Machine-Learning-Courses
Amazon has released the first three courses from their internal machine learning university. I will be going through these courses as they before available. The goal of making this repository is
 to better understand machine learning as well as to try and uncover what Amazon values in their new hires for machine learning. I will be going through their default notebooks and as I find time
 I will reimplement them using Tensorflow and then PyTorch.
